After the Deadline isn't just *another* spell checker.... it's smarter, because it uses context to determine what you really mean. It can tell that this word should be "consider" and this should be "connoisseur."

And now with After the Deadline for Firefox, you can take this powerful proofreading tool everywhere on the web. On twitter... facebook... linkedin... wherever you see the "check" button, like in this gmail plain text editor, click it to activate proofreading. Right click to accept a suggestion, ignore it, or choose to always ignore that word. You can even choose "Explain" and learn more about the error.

You can also activate proofreading from the context menu or by pressing a key combination: by default, F7. On many sites on the web, After the Deadline can also notify you if you try to submit a form before it's been proofread.

In addition to spelling, grammar, and misused words, After the Deadline can also give you style suggestions. Just go to Tools > Addons > and choose Preferences. Let After the Deadline help you avoid clich√©s, the passive voice, or redundant phrasing, just to name a few.
